Projects
 Diabetes Prediction
A healthcare analytics project predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health indicators.

Jupyter Notebook: Diabetes Prediction Notebook
Dataset: Synthetic Diabetes Dataset
Presentation: Diabetes Prediction Presentation
Trained Model: Gradient Boosting Model
Project Highlights
Objective: Predict diabetes risk to enable proactive healthcare measures.
Models Used:
Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 48.7%)
Random Forest (Accuracy: 50.0%)
Gradient Boosting (Accuracy: 74.0%)
Key Features:
Glucose, BMI, and Age were the most significant predictors of diabetes.
Outcome: Gradient Boosting achieved the best balance between precision and recall, making it the most reliable model.
